There are tips and trick in proper art framing which will have you thinking about frames in a new way. Here at Bass Rock Framing & Gallery in Dunbar all the framing is done by Peter Bowman. Peter is a retired award winning architect and member of the Fine Art Trade Guild. His expert knowledge can be trusted no matter how simple or complicated our job is.</p><p>The act of picture framing is an art unto itself when you think about what it is trying to achieve. Here are some simple tips and advice that will help you get the most out of your pictures, images or artwork.</p><p>Go Classic</p><p>Basically, the frame you choose should be one that holds the test of time. Trends may come and go, but there are certain types of frames that never go out of style. So, for the art, pictures or images that you want to present for years to come, remember to select simple, straightforward frames that will work in any era no matter what changes you might make to your home during that time.</p><p>Invest Properly</p><p>If you are going to put artwork in your home or perhaps images and photos that mean a great deal to you, then invest in the right materials such as the proper glass and matting that will last. While it is more expensive, the result is that you have the frame materials that are designed to last far longer than their cheaper counterparts. You can reserve this investment for your more expensive art or valuable portraits, but the end result is having better protection that lasts for a long period of time.</p><p>Choose the Right Art Framer</p><p>Youâ€™ll want to choose the best picture framing East Lothian or picture framing Dunbar specialist for your needs. Their expertise will be invaluable during this time when you are trusting their judgment to bring out the most from your art or images. Once you have chosen the best in your region, the next step is working with them to determine just how the item inside will be secured to the framing material. This is why having an expert can make the difference between having your art, image or photo last for a lifetime and one that may suffer from irreversible damage because the workmanship was at fault.</p><p>Be Conservative</p><p>While most framers will present the image or art in the best possible light, there are those who may ask you for multiple mats, fancy cuts or even double frames to showcase what you have. Quite often, these are unnecessary measure that only drives up the cost while taking away from the piece itself. You should let the art inside stand on its own in these cases and go as minimal as possible while still offering maximum protection. Remember, a great frame is one that accentuates what is inside, not downplays it.</p><picture>
